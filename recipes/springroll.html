    <li>¾ cup cooked rice vermicelli</li>
    <li>4 ounces shredded cooked chicken</li>

    <li>¼ cup chopped fresh mint</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons tzatziki sauce</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Directions</h3>

    <li>Fill a 9-inch pie plate with warm water; dip 1 rice paper into the water. 
      Transfer to a work surface and let stand for a few seconds to soften.</li>
    <li>Snip cooked rice noodles. Arrange 3 tablespoons noodles across the lower 1/3 of the softened rice paper.
